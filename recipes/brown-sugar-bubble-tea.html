        <h1>Brown Sugar Bubble Tea</h1>
        <p>Boba tea, also known as <strong>bubble tea</strong>, is a popular Taiwanese beverage that combines tea, milk, sweetener, and chewy <em>tapioca</em> pearls, often referred to as <em>"boba"</em>.
        The drink typically starts with a base of black, green, or oolong tea, which is then mixed with milk or a non-dairy alternative and sweetened to taste. 
        The signature tapioca pearls are small, chewy balls made from tapioca starch, giving the drink its unique texture.</p>
        
        <p>Boba tea is usually served cold, with ice, and comes in a variety of flavors, ranging from classic milk tea to fruity options like mango or strawberry. 
        It's often topped with a wide straw, allowing the drinker to sip up the boba pearls along with the tea. 
        Variations can include additional toppings like fruit jelly, popping boba filled with juice, or even a layer of frothy cheese foam.</p>

        <p>This drink has gained worldwide popularity for its refreshing taste, playful texture, and the customizable options that allow each cup to be uniquely tailored to the drinker’s preferences.</p>
        <p>This is what do you need to make a bubble tea at home.</p>
        <p><h2>Ingridients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Water - 4 ¼ cups, divided</li>
            <li>White tapioca pearls (boba) - ¼ cup</li>
            <li>Black tea leaves - 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Brown sugar - ¼ cup </li>                
            <li>Ice - 1 cup, cubes</li>
            <li>Milk - ¼ cup</li>
            <li>Sweetened condensed milk - 2 tablespoons</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Notes</h2></p>
        <p>Substitute 4 tea bags for the loose-leaf tea if preferred. Use any kind of black or green tea you like!
            I did not use quick-cooking tapioca pearls. If you buy that variety, either online or from an Asian market, follow the cooking instructions on the package.
            Boba are best if used within a few hours of cooking, but will keep refrigerated for a few days. They will gradually harden over time.</p>
